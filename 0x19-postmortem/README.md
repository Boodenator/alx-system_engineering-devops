Impact:

The main web application experienced severe performance degradation, resulting in 60% of users encountering slow page load times and intermittent timeouts. Approximately 40% of API requests failed, leading to broken functionality for most users.

Root Cause:
The root cause was a memory leak in the server-side caching mechanism, which caused the application server to exhaust its available memory, leading to frequent garbage collection cycles and significant performance degradation.


Root Cause and Resolution

A-Root Cause: The issue was caused by a memory leak within the server-side caching mechanism. The caching system, designed to store frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval, was not properly releasing memory for items that were no longer needed. Over time, this caused the application server's memory usage to increase steadily until it reached the system's limits. Once the memory was exhausted, the server entered frequent garbage collection cycles, which severely degraded performance and led to API request failures.

B-Resolution: The immediate resolution involved disabling the caching mechanism, which stopped the memory leak and allowed the server to operate normally. The server's memory usage gradually decreased as the leak was no longer present, and performance returned to acceptable levels. The caching mechanism was identified as the primary cause, and a patch was developed to fix the memory management issue.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

1-Memory Management in Caching: Review and refactor the server-side caching mechanism to ensure proper memory management, including the timely release of unused cache items.
2-Enhanced Monitoring: Implement detailed monitoring for memory usage, particularly for caching mechanisms, to detect abnormal patterns early.
3-Load Testing: Conduct thorough load testing, including stress tests that specifically target memory-intensive operations, before deploying new features.
4-Incident Response Procedures: Update incident response playbooks to include steps for quickly identifying and isolating memory leaks in the future.

Task List:

 Patch the server-side caching mechanism to address the memory leak.
 1-Add monitoring alerts specifically for unusual memory usage patterns in the caching system.
 2-Conduct a full audit of memory usage across all services and components in the stack.
 3-Schedule a load test for the patched caching mechanism to validate the fix.
 4-Review and update the incident response documentation to include memory leak identification procedures.
